# [jTypes: IDE](http://www.jTypes.com/develop) - Development Studio

## JavaScript Console

The jTypes JavaScript console was built for the upcoming jTypes interactive development environment (IDE). It provides an organized and easily customizable interface that is completely browser-independent. By utilizing jTypes 2.1.7, it demonstrates for developers the many benefits of using a class-based design pattern when working on large scale applications and libraries.

This console can be quite useful for bloggers or on documentation pages to provide your users with the ability to not just read your code or have it highlighted, but also to actually execute it and experiment with it (when applicable).
